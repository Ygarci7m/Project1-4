<h1><u>&hearts;About me&hearts;</u></h1>
<p>My name is <i>Yesenia</i>. I am a full-time student here at Cerritos College. I have been in and out of school for the last 10 years, unsure of what I want to do for the rest of my life. I have my AA in criminal justice and mental health, and I am 3 units short of obtaining my Psychology degree. I work full-time as a case manager, where I work with adults living with mental illness. I enjoy what I do, but it is not something I see myself doing for the next 30 or 40 years. I hope that this class rekindles my love for coding and allows me to be a part of something bigger as technology continues to grow. I have a dog named Nova and 2 cats, Kitty and Junior.</p>
<h2>When I have free time</h2> 
<ol>
  <li>I enjoy playing with makeup and creating new looks.</li>
  <li>I enjoy spending time with my family and my animals.</li>
  <li>I love playing video games.</li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.sephora.com/">Sephora</a> because I love anything to do with beauty.</p>
